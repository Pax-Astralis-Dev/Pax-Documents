## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Pax Astralis Central Command! As a community administrator, also known as a member of Central Command, your role is crucial in maintaining a positive and immersive gaming environment for our players. This handbook provides guidelines and procedures to help you effectively fulfill your responsibilities.

## 2. Handling aHelps

### 2.1 Responding to aHelps

When responding to aHelps, it is important to maintain a professional and helpful demeanor. Start your response by addressing the player username and later mention it second time. For example: 1) Hello Username, how can I help you? 2) Exactly, Username. Just a moment please. 3) Do you need any additional help Username?


### 2.2 Avoiding Direct Intervention

Whenever possible, refrain from intervening directly in the game. Instead, encourage players to handle in-game situations in-character. This helps maintain the immersive experience for all players. Direct PMing should be minimized to avoid disrupting gameplay immersion.

## 3. Quality Assurance Management

### 3.1 Scoring System

To ensure consistent and high-quality support, administrators will be evaluated using a detailed scoring system:

- **Mentioning Player's Username (2 scores):** Assign 2 scores for properly mentioning the player's username twice during an aHelp session.
  
- **Asking if Additional Assistance is Needed (1 score):** Assign 1 score for asking if the player requires further assistance.

- **Empathy and Understanding (2 scores):** Assign 2 scores based on the administrator's demonstrated empathy and understanding of the aHelper's situation.

- **Remaining Polite and Keeping Cool (Additional scores during confrontation):** Extra scores can be given if the administrator maintains a calm and polite demeanor during tough aHelp situations, especially when confronted by the player.

- **Knowledge, Research, and Technical Help (2 scores):** Assign 2 scores for demonstrating knowledge, conducting research, and providing technical assistance during aHelp sessions.

- **Correct Answer (2 scores):** Assign 2 scores for providing the correct answer to the aHelp inquiry.

- **Good Closure of aHelp (1 score):** Assign 1 score for effectively closing the aHelp session on a positive note.

Admins are encouraged to learn and improve from these scores to provide better assistance in the future.

## 4. In-Character Approach and Delegating Enforcement

Maintaining an in-character approach is vital for preserving the immersive atmosphere of Pax Astralis. Address issues and conflicts in-character rather than resorting to out-of-character interventions. For minor offences such as rule violations 2, 5, and 6, delegate enforcement to Low Command as much as possible. These offences can often be handled entirely in-character, and Low Command serves as Central Command's assistant in promoting an in-character resolution approach.

## 5. Dealing with Self-Antagging

In the event of self-antagging, follow the established in-character retaliation procedure:

1. **Send a CentComm Spec Ops Team:** Coordinate with other administrators or event coordinators to dispatch a CentComm Spec Ops team to confront the self-antagger. If there are no ghosts available, you can be a lone NT operative to hunt the self-antagger.

2. **Bluespace Artillery Ship:** Initiate the call for a Bluespace Artillery Ship. This process takes 35 minutes, providing ample time for the in-game scenario to unfold naturally. Once the ship arrives, the self-antagger can be hit by bluespace artillery missile which kills them immediately. 

3. **Support the Death Squad:** The Bluespace Artillery Ship can also be utilized to support the CentComm Spec Ops team. Ensure that the response is proportional and aligned with the storyline.

Self-antagging, if it happens in a single case and does not include mass RDM, does not need to be documented. Please see below procedure for handling more extreme offences.

## 6. Dealing with Extreme Offences

Extreme offences include:
- Mass RDM (2 or more random murders)
- Mass Sabotage (Theft of station funds, intentionally causing severe damage to either station or other users' shuttles, disabling atmos or "spacing" rooms, or otherwise make either the station or other users' shuttles uninhabitatable).
- Erotic roleplay (ERP) or any other sexual content.
- Usage of exploits or game modifications.
- Ban evasion.

In cases of such extreme offences, follow these procedures:

- **Mass RDM and Mass Sabotage:**
  1st time: 3-day ban
  2nd time: 7-day ban
  3rd time: 14-day ban
  4th time: Appealable permanent ban

- **Other offences:**
  - Erotic roleplay (ERP) or any other sexual content: Appealable permanent ban.
  - Usage of exploits or game modifications: Appealable permanent ban.
  - Ban evasion: Appealable permanent ban.

These are always documented with the noting system. 

By adhering to these guidelines, you contribute to the overall success of Pax Astralis and help create a vibrant and enjoyable gaming environment. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to Central Command!
